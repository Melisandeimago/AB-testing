# A/B testing

- [✨ A/B Test Project](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1azWgD-kHgMrgN3Rp30arNihlcLdzPvuK1db2LSSw6UE/edit?usp=sharing)

### Task requirements
- You should prepare SQL query which would pull all data needed and similarly as before estimate if different variants of marketing campaigns (V1 vs V2) for both “NewYear” and “BlackFriday” campaigns had significantly better clickthrough rates (estimated as: number of users who clicked on campaign / number of impressions).
- For now you can ignore timing of user tracking data, you do not need to check if those sessions were recorded when the marketing campaign was running.
- Run the A/B testing on the results from your query.
- You can use Binomial A/B test Calculator.
- Bonus points if you create your own/custom A/B testing for this exercise.
- Add visualizations to help illustrate A/B testing results.
